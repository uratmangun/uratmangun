PROJECT NAME
OpenRouter Free Models

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A TypeScript utility that discovers and showcases all free AI models available on OpenRouter through an interactive ASCII art generator. The project demonstrates the capabilities of free language models by creating creative ASCII art from AI-generated prompts.

TAGLINE
openrouter,ai,typescript

WHAT IT DOES
Automatically fetches all free models from OpenRouter API, filters them by pricing, and creates an ASCII art generator that uses random free models to generate creative prompts and corresponding ASCII artwork. Saves model data as JSON for programmatic use.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Developers struggle to discover which AI models on OpenRouter are completely free to use. This tool eliminates the guesswork by automatically identifying free models and demonstrating their capabilities through practical ASCII art generation.

CHALLENGES I RAN INTO
Handling API rate limits and model availability, implementing robust retry logic for failed model calls, managing different model response formats, and creating fallback mechanisms when API keys are unavailable or models fail to respond.

TECHNOLOGIES I USED
TypeScript for type safety, Node.js runtime, OpenRouter API for model access, tsx for TypeScript execution, dotenv for environment management, node-fetch for HTTP requests, and ES modules for modern JavaScript architecture.

HOW WE BUILT IT
Built with TypeScript using ES modules, implemented API client for OpenRouter, created model filtering logic, developed ASCII art generation with retry mechanisms, added random prompt generation, and integrated file I/O for caching model data.

WHAT WE LEARNED
Learned about OpenRouter's model ecosystem, API integration patterns, error handling strategies for AI services, TypeScript module systems, and the importance of fallback mechanisms when working with external AI APIs.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR
Planning to add web interface, support for image generation models, model performance benchmarking, integration with more AI providers, batch ASCII art generation, and community sharing features for generated artwork.

UPDATE OF THIS PROJECT TODAY
Recently updated with comprehensive documentation, improved error handling, enhanced TypeScript types, better project structure, and added development workflows. The ASCII art generator now includes robust retry logic and fallback mechanisms.
